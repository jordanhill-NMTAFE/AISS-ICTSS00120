    "\n",
    "In this project, you will apply supervised learning techniques to automate a task within a workplace environment of your choice. You are required to select a task, source or synthesize adequate training data, and train a supervised deep learning model to automate the selected task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please follow the steps outlined below and complete each section with your code and explanations. Use this notebook to document your process, from understanding the dataset, preprocessing the data, building your model, and evaluating its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to keep your code well-commented and structured. Before submission, ensure that your notebook runs from start to finish without errors.\n",

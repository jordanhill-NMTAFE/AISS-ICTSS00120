### Marking Guide: AT1 Identify Opportunities for AI Task Automation

---

#### Task 1: Identify an Opportunity for Task Automation
##### Instructions: 
Identify a specific task within your organization that could benefit from automation. Describe the task in detail, including the current process, any existing challenges, and the desired outcome from automation. Confirm your ideas with required personnel.

Your response must include the following:
1. A description of the current work task per organizational policies and procedures.
2. Details on how the automation aligns with organizational productivity goals.
3. An overview of any existing technologies or processes related to the task currently used by the workplace.

```
Example Response:
One potential task for automation is the initial triage and response to customer service inquiries. Currently, customer service representatives manually review and categorize incoming messages, which can be time-consuming and inconsistent.
Automating this task would involve implementing a system that automatically classifies and routes inquiries based on their content. This aligns with our goal to reduce response times and increase customer satisfaction by ensuring inquiries are handled promptly and accurately.
Existing technologies include a basic email management system that sorts messages into folders based on keywords. However, this system is limited and often misclassifies emails, requiring manual intervention.
```
---
*The student should identify a relevant and detailed task suitable for automation, describe it clearly, and explain how it aligns with organizational productivity goals. They should also mention any current technologies in use.*

---

#### Task 2: Consider AI, ML, & DL Technologies
##### Instructions: 
Research and provide an overview of three different technologies across Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning (one of each).

Your response must perform the following:
1. Identify and research three AI techniques suitable for the automation task.
2. Research and confirm application procedures for each AI, ML & DL technology.

```
Example Response:
**Artificial Intelligence (AI) Solution:**
Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be used to handle and classify customer inquiries by analyzing the text content. It enables the system to understand and respond to queries automatically.

**Machine Learning (ML) Solution:**
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model can be trained to categorize emails based on labeled examples. This model can improve over time with more data, increasing its accuracy and value in sorting messages effectively.

**Deep Learning (DL) Solution:**
A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, specifically using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), can be applied to understand the context and intent behind customer inquiries, providing sophisticated responses.
```
---
*Students should clearly describe each technology (AI, ML, DL), showing an understanding of what each one does and how it applies to the task. They should confirm application procedures for each technology.*

---

#### Task 3: Assess the Suitability of Each Technique
##### Instructions: 
Critically assess the suitability of each AI technique mentioned in Task 2. Consider how each technique can meet the desired outcomes, potential technical limitations, challenges, and risks.

Your response should contain:
1. Analysis of the application procedure for the three AI technologies.
2. Documentation of the advantages and disadvantages of each AI technique.
3. Documentation of identified implementation risks for each AI technique.

```
Example Response:
**NLP for AI:**
Application Procedure: Implement NLP to classify and respond to inquiries based on detected keywords.
Advantages: Automated responses can be consistent and quick.
Disadvantages: Limited understanding of nuanced inquiries.
Risks: Misclassification of complex messages could lead to customer dissatisfaction.

**SVM for ML:**
Application Procedure: Train an SVM model on past customer inquiries to predict categories.
Advantages: Easy to interpret and robust with less computational power required.
Disadvantages: May struggle with large, complex datasets.
Risks: Model may not generalize well, leading to misclassification.

**RNN with LSTM for DL:**
Application Procedure: Set up an RNN model to understand context and intent behind inquiries.
Advantages: High accuracy in understanding complex and contextual language.
Disadvantages: Computationally intensive and requires large amounts of data.
Risks: Overfitting, high training times, and resource requirements.
```
---
*The student should analyze and document the application procedure, advantages, and disadvantages of each technique. They should also identify any potential implementation risks.*

---

#### Task 4: Recommendation and Justification
##### Instructions: 
Based on your assessments in Task 3, choose the AI technique you believe to be the most suitable candidate for automating the identified task. Clearly justify your choice and put together a brief proposal for implementing this solution within your organization.

Your response should contain:
- The final submission of your AI implementation proposal to required personnel.

```
Example Response:
I recommend using the RNN with LSTM for automating customer service inquiries. Despite its higher computational requirements, the ability to understand context and provide accurate responses makes it the most suitable technology for our needs.

**Proposal:**

1. **Implementation Plan:**
   - Set up an RNN model with LSTM units.
   - Train the model on a dataset of past inquiries.
   - Integrate with our existing email management system.

2. **Resources Required:**
   - High-performance GPUs for training.
   - Access to a large dataset of labeled customer inquiries.

3. **Timeline:**
   - Phase 1: Data collection and preprocessing (1 month).
   - Phase 2: Model training and evaluation (2 months).
   - Phase 3: Integration and testing (1 month).

4. **Expected Outcomes:**
   - Reduced response times.
   - Increased customer satisfaction.

5. **Stakeholder Sign-off:**
   - Project sign-off from key stakeholders and departments involved.
```
---
*The student should provide a comprehensive recommendation and proposal outlining the chosen technology. They should justify their choice based on the analysis in Task 3 and include a detailed implementation plan.*

---

#### Task 5: Presentation
##### Instructions: 
Prepare a presentation summarizing your findings from Tasks 1-4, highlighting the key aspects of your recommendation and the rationale behind your chosen solution. Present this summary to your peers and address any questions they may have.

---
*Observe the student's presentation. They should incorporate relevant feedback and effectively communicate their findings and recommendations. Ensure they address questions confidently and accurately.*

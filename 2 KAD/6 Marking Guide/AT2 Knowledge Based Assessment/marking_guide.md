```
Example Response:
Decision Trees are supervised learning algorithms utilized for both classification and regression tasks. They learn by recursively partitioning the data into subsets based on the values of input features, forming a tree-like structure of decision rules. At each node, the algorithm selects the feature that provides the best split according to criteria like Gini impurity or information gain (entropy). This splitting continues until a stopping condition is met, such as reaching a maximum depth or having a minimum number of samples in a node.

These principles influence their decision-making capabilities by allowing the model to make decisions through a series of simple if-then rules derived from the data features. This makes decision trees highly interpretable, as one can trace the path from the root to a leaf node to understand how a decision was made.

Discuss the potential implications and risks of using biased datasets in AI model development and deployment, including real-world examples where bias has affected outcomes. Provide strategies for detecting and mitigating data bias to ensure fair and equitable AI systems.*


```
Example Response:
An unbiased dataset in machine learning is one that accurately reflects the complete diversity and distribution of the population it is intended to model, without overrepresenting or underrepresenting any subgroup. This ensures that the machine learning model trained on such data can generalize well and make fair predictions across all segments of the population. Conversely, a biased dataset is characterized by systematic errors or imbalances that favor certain groups over others, leading to models that can produce skewed or discriminatory outcomes.

The use of biased datasets in AI model development can result in significant risks and negative implications. For example, models may perpetuate social biases, discriminate against minority groups, and make unfair decisions that affect individuals' lives. A notable real-world example is the COMPAS algorithm used in the US criminal justice system, which was found to be biased against African American individuals, leading to unfair risk assessments. Another example is facial recognition technology performing poorly on women and people of color due to biased training data.

To detect and mitigate data bias, strategies include:

- **Data Assessment and Preprocessing**: Analyze the dataset for imbalances or anomalies. Use techniques like re-sampling, stratification, or data augmentation to balance the dataset.
- **Fairness Metrics**: Employ statistical measures such as demographic parity, equal opportunity, or disparate impact ratio to evaluate and monitor model fairness across different subgroups.
- **Diverse Data Collection**: Ensure that data collection processes are inclusive and representative of all relevant populations.
- **Algorithmic Techniques**: Implement fairness-aware machine learning algorithms that are designed to minimize bias.
